/**
 * The nine AI Stack tabs, for any module.
 *
 * ALL NINE ARE LIVE, AND ALL NINE ARE SCOPED TO ONE MODULE
 *
 * Each renders its own shared screen with this module's descriptor, and each is
 * decentralised in the sense that matters to the person using it: it shows only this
 * module's configuration, and a save from it cannot be filed against another module. The
 * module is never a control the operator can reach — it is a parameter this file supplies
 * and no form offers.
 *
 * DECENTRALISED IS NOT DUPLICATED
 *
 * There is no second AI stack inside any module. Every screen calls the same client, the
 * same endpoint and the same table as the central AI console, scoped to the module's key:
 *
 *   Policies       → ai_policies with a `module` assignment
 *   Models         → ai_module_model_bindings for this module, beside the resolution
 *                    the module's next call will actually get
 *   Prompts        → ai_templates, this module_key, kind = prompt
 *   Templates      → ai_templates, this module_key, kind = report
 *   Knowledge Base → the module's read-only MCP tools, from the backend tool registry
 *   Automations    → the module's bound agent, if any, plus the central Agent Management
 *                    engine scoped to this module
 *   Usage & Cost   → ai_conversations.module_key, this module's generations, the quota
 *   Guardrails     → the five places a guardrail is actually enforced
 *   Activity       → ai_audit_logs rows under `module.<key>.*`
 *
 * So a change to any of those contracts breaks the central screen and every module's at
 * compile time, rather than leaving one quietly wrong. No table, column or store was added
 * to make these tabs module-specific — every module filter is a column the schema already
 * had.
 *
 * NO TAB DOES ANOTHER TAB'S JOB. Prompts and Templates are both `ai_templates` rows split
 * by `kind`, because a prompt is text sent to a model and a report is a layout filled from
 * records. Guardrails reads what the other tabs configure and offers no second place to
 * change it.
 *
 * MODELS WRITES, AND NOTHING IT WRITES LEAVES THE MODULE
 *
 * Fees once removed its Models tab, and Attendance, Admission and Student made theirs
 * read-only mirrors with links out, on the reasoning that a per-module model editor is a
 * second place to change one estate-wide setting. That was wrong about what is being
 * edited. A module choosing its own model is not a second way to write the estate's
 * default — it is a different setting with a different scope, and the two now live in
 * different tables:
 *
 *   this tab            `ai_module_model_bindings` — product module × capability.
 *                       "When Fees makes a conversational call, use this model."
 *   AI & Intelligence   `ai_api_keys` and `ai_models` — capability, estate-wide.
 *                       "Conversational AI runs on this provider by default."
 *
 * So neither console can move the other's row, and a module with no binding inherits the
 * estate default exactly as before. All four hand-written stacks now mount this same
 * screen, so no module's Models tab navigates to AI & Intelligence — the decentralised
 * stack is finished inside the module it belongs to.
